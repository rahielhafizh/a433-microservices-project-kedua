This is the second assignment for the "Learn to Build Microservices Architecture" course. This project involves deploying the Karsa Jobs application on Kubernetes, using a starter project provided by Dicoding Academy. The tasks include forking and cloning specific branches from GitHub, creating shell scripts for building Docker images, deploying the application on Kubernetes using Minikube, and implementing Continuous Integration (CI) using CircleCI, Jenkins or GitHub Actions. Additionally, monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana needs to be deployed in a dedicated namespace named "monitoring".
