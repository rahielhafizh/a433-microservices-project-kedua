This is the second project of the course  “Learn to Build Microservices Architecture”. The application is deployed using Kubernetes with Minikube. It covers scripting for building Docker images, configuring Kubernetes resources, and implementing monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana in a custom namespace. Continuous integration (CI) is implemented with tools such as CircleCI, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions, that implement continuous integration, scalable application deployment, and the ability to maintain complex multi-environment systems.
